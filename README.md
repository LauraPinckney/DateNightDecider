# Team-8-The-Tech-Titans-plus-One

Date Night Decider is an application created during first hackathon of my bootcamp to decide on what to do for date night. Random selector of movie, cocktail and trivia to go through whilst the movie is loaded and cocktail is made. Used various APIs and worked in a team of two.
